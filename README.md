# **Sonar Data Classification**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying sonar signals as rocks or mines using a logistic regression model. The dataset used for this project was sourced from a sonar signal classification dataset.

---

## **Overview**

The goal of this project is to classify sonar signals as either **rocks** or **mines** using machine learning techniques. Sonar data is collected by bouncing sound waves off objects and analyzing the returned signals. This type of classification has applications in underwater object detection and exploration.

The dataset consists of 60 numerical features representing energy values at different frequencies, with a target variable indicating whether the signal corresponds to a rock (`R`) or a mine (`M`).

## **Dataset**

- **Source**: The dataset appears to be related to sonar signal classification (e.g., [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Sonar Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))).
- **Features**:
  - 60 numerical columns representing signal energy at different frequencies.
  - The last column contains the target variable:
    - `R`: Rock
    - `M`: Mine
- **Rows**: 208 samples in total.

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Loading**:
   - The dataset (`SonarData.csv`) is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Basic statistics and structure of the dataset are examined.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Logistic Regression is used as the classification model.
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model's accuracy is calculated using `accuracy_score`.

## **How to Run**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SonarDataClassification.git
   cd SonarDataClassification
   ```

2. Ensure that the dataset file (`SonarData.csv`) is in the same directory as the notebook.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Main_001-1.ipynb
   ```

4. Run all cells in the notebook to execute the code.

## **Results**

The logistic regression model provides an accuracy score that indicates its performance in classifying sonar signals as rocks or mines. Further improvements can be made by exploring other machine learning models or feature engineering techniques.
